<h1>Alfie Solomons</h1>
<p><img src="images/Peaky blinders alfie solomons.jpg" alt="Alfie Solomons"></p>

<p>Alfred "Alfie" Solomons is a Jewish gang leader who resides in Camden Town, London. It is implied that Alfie is originally from Russia, where his mother is from and that he went to school in London with Darby Sabini.
Violent and unpredictable, but intelligent and calculating, he is a master negotiator who uses violent outbursts and confusing language to intimidate and dominate everyone around him.
Aside from being a veteran of World War One, little else is known about his background but for the fact that his mother was a Jew who fled persecution in Russia. He understands Russian well. Currently, he uses a bakery as a cover for his distillery.</p>
