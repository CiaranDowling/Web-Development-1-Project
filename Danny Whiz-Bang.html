<h1>Danny Whizz-Bang</h1>

<p>Daniel Owen, known as Danny Whizz-Bang, was a member of the Peaky Blinders who served in France with Thomas Shelby and Freddie Thorne. After the war, he began suffering from violent psychotic episodes where he believed he was still at war, earning him the nickname "whizz-bang" after a term Allied soldiers used during and after the First World War to describe the noise made by German artillery shells.
Through Thomas's nightmares, it is revealed that Danny was in the same deep dugout as Freddie Thorne and Thomas Shelby. As the German Tunnelers were about to breach, Danny took the lead in the tunnels. Carefully listening to the digging and whispers from the other side, he was suddenly hit in the head with a shovel. As one of the German tunnelers had Thomas in a chokehold, trying to suffocate him, Danny stabbed the enemy in the back, saving Thomas's life.</p>
