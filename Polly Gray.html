<p><img src="images/Peaky_Aunt_Polly_Main.jpg" alt="Polly Gray"></p>
<p>Elizabeth "Polly" Gray (nï¿½e Shelby) is the matriarch of the Shelby Family and the treasurer of the Birmingham criminal gang, the Peaky Blinders. She managed the Peaky Blinders when the Shelby boys were absent during the Great War. She is the unofficial head of the Shelby Family and often advises Thomas Shelby on the gang's business.
When she was sixteen she became pregnant and aborted the child on her own. She later married and had two children, Anna and Michael. However, both her children were taken from her by the authorities, in part due to the intervention of a neighbour.</p>
