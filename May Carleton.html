<h1>May Carleton</h1>
<p><img src="images/May Carleton.jpg" alt="May Carleton"></p>

<p>May Carleton is a horse trainer and rich widow, who is enlisted by Thomas Shelby to train his horse for Epsom. She also enjoys the company of bad boys.
May Carleton comes from a well-to-do family. She is well connected with everyone from the war-office to racing-board. Since her husband�s death, she has lived alone in her late husband�s mansion. Though she's a rich widow and a successful race-horse trainer, she is lonely and bored with her strait-laced life.</p>
