<p>Michael Gray is the son of Polly Gray and cousin of the Shelby siblings. He is the Chief Accountant in the Shelby Company Limited.
Michael was taken from Polly when he was five years old by the police. He lived with a foster family until he was 17, when he first met Thomas and became introduced to the Shelby family. His adopted mother and family used to refer to him by the name "Henry" for what is assumed to be many years.
It is also revealed that Michael was abused by a priest during his short time in foster care, which fuels his hatred towards them in Series 3.</p>
