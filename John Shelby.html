<h1>John Shelby<h/h1>
<p><img src="images/John Shelby.jpg" alt="Arthur Shelby"></p>

<p>John Michael Shelby, also called Johnny or John Boy, is the third of Shelby siblings. Along with his two older brothers Thomas and Arthur Shelby Jr., John was a soldier of the Warwickshire Yeomanry, which served as cavalry and machine gunners in the First World War.

Being the third oldest Shelby, John frequently attends any Shelby family meetings that take place in the Shelby Home. From these meetings it is evident that John both does not trust and dislikes coppers, and isn't afraid to hurt them to make them leave the Peaky Blinders alone.

John idolises the Peaky Blinders moniker; the whole image and what they stand for. While Thomas is cut-throat, John is more the heart of the family. He's not quite got it in him, not for want of trying.</p>
