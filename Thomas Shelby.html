<h1>Thomas Shelby</h1>
<img src="images/peaky blinders thomas shelby.jpg" alt="Thomas Shelby">

<p>Thomas 'Tommy' Michael Shelby is the leader of the Birmingham criminal gang Peaky Blinders and the patriarch of the Shelby Family. His experiences during and after the First World War have left him disillusioned and determined to move his family up in the world.
Thomas Shelby is a former british soldier and his war record states that he fought bravely at the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of Somme. His actions at Mons reportedly saved thousands of allied lives, for which he received medals of honour after the War, including the Military Medal and the Distinguished Conduct Medal.
It is implied that there was a drastic personality shift before and after his experiences in the First World War plus after the War he began experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
